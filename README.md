# BlazorDataTable
 
This is a personal project done to create a data table functionality using blazor.

To have a flexibility of objects that can be used it was used reflection and linq in the component base - DataTableComponentBase.Cs

To have the sort functionality in place it was used the display name in the models - WeatherForecast.Cs

It was created a component that can be reusable anywhere with any list of objects - DataTable.razor

The working example is in FecthData.razor
